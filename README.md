Text2Link Safari Extension
================

This simple extension allows you to double- or right-click links
written in plain text to open them.

Based on the idea of a similar [Firefox plugin][], this
functionality is now available for Safari.
 Now you can double-click on plain text like: **http://firedev.com**
to have it opened like it was a link!

Also you can open links in new tab or new window.

### Test cases

You can double- or right-click any of these text strings like it was
a link:
